        <h1>Autonomous car</h1>
        <p class="subtitulo">Final degree project that includes the electronics of an autonomous vehicle. Done in partnership with another course colleague.</p>

        <p>In this project, PCBs were designed and produced to make the electronic part of the vehicle. This being my first contact with PCB design, I can say that I loved it and for that reason I do it with you in my free time.</p>
        <p>I would like to share all the schematics, layouts of the PCBs and all the programming, however I fear that it may suffer from ownership issues due to it being made at the university and possibly still being used.</p>
        <h2>Turn Signal PCB</h2>
        <p>The first PCB to be corrected and produced was the one for the turn signals, I say corrected because it had already been started to be developed the previous year by other colleagues, hence the names of the same. This super simple PCB has only 3 RGB LEDs and the output for communication with them, these allow several to be interconnected and controlled individually.</p>

        <h2>Turn Signal PCB Controller</h2>
        <p>This PCB contains a PIC18F that controls the LEDs on the turn signal PCB via SPI communication. We can see that the soldering is not the best but we were new to that too :)</p>

        <h2>Car steering PCB</h2>
        <p>A PCB with a PIC32 capable of controlling the vehicle's servo motor in order to control its direction was developed.</p>

        <p>This PCB allowed the vehicle's steering to be controlled and adjusted according to the error associated with mechanical steering. These errors and deviations were obtained through experimental tests. </p>
